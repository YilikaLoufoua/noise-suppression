**[INCOMPLETE]**

This version of the model is a matlab implementation of the paper ["FullSubNet: A Full-Band and Sub-Band Fusion Model for Real-Time Single-Channel Speech Enhancement"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.15508).This version of a model uses fusion of sub-band and full-band and is trained using [DNS dataset](https://github.com/microsoft/DNS-Challenge).

Although our team tried our best to write out the model, we are still not able to produce satisfactory training result. The best RMSE is ~40. Nonetheless, we have included the trained model after 16 hours in the folder.
