        %Args:
        %    num_freqs: Frequency dim of the input
        %    look_ahead: Number of use of the future frames
        %    fb_num_neighbors: How much neighbor frequencies at each side from fullband model's output
        %    sb_num_neighbors: How much neighbor frequencies at each side from noisy spectrogram
        %    sequence_model: Chose one sequence model as the basic model e.g., GRU, LSTM
        %    fb_output_activate_function: fullband model's activation function
        %    sb_output_activate_function: subband model's activation function
        %    norm_type: type of normalization, see more details in "BaseModel" class
